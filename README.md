# Human Activity Recognition Analysis with PySpark

## Description
This project involves analyzing human activity data collected from wearable devices to classify various physical activities using machine learning algorithms.

## Dataset
The dataset `HAR_3000.csv` contains sensor readings and activity labels for human activity recognition.

## Tasks Performed
1. Data exploration and preprocessing.
2. Feature engineering for classification models.
3. Hyperparameter tuning and evaluation using Logistic Regression and Random Forest.

## Results
- Best accuracy using the full dataset: **97.7%**
- Accuracy using the subset dataset: **91.8%**
